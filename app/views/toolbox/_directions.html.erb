			<strong>API Validation: </strong>The Application will reguraly check if your account belongs to any corporations or alliances on the contact list with a standing of more than 0.  At the moment this check is run ever 15 min.  but this is easy to change.  In addition it only requires name and assoiciation to be included in the API but I have it request an access key that only has required data.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Time Sheet: </strong>This was the first feature written into the site, may need some refactoring and having it work with the discord bot is a priority after the site goes live.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>SRP Request forms: </strong>Request forms can be replied to by elevated users but seeing as this role requires alliance wallet access so at the moment it requires restricted access.  It also generates a unique ID for each transaction if you want to track them... this feature is very bare bones at the moment but it acts as a formal request system.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Forum / Message Board: </strong>Validated users and groups can post in a simple message board.  Locked groups are possible and tiered permissions
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>Discord Role Bot: </strong>This bot wil clone marked chat groups with their discord counterparts for chat functions.  The membership updates with the Auth check that run on a schedule.  Memberships have to be approved by elevated members inorder to apply to discord.  Also the bot sometimes hits the request cap and will not add roles if too many change in one turn (with the exception of the clear all function).  If there are any issues with the auth on this application it will wipe your Discord roles.

        <p>
        This link will create an API key with public infromation only.  Enter the required fields generated by the key into your account page, if the app is able to pull all nessessary infromation then you will be flagged as an active user and granted access.  It is reccomended to not have old API keys active and if you leave the alliance or corporation running this site then it will still have access to the key until it is deleted.

      	At the moment I am a lazy bum and havent figured out how to collect a discord ID through a invite link or O-auth.  You can input your Discord ID manually but it requires you to get your Discord ID from the server.  (the ID is unique to the server enviroment)
      	<ol>
      	<li>Under user settings you will need to turn developer mode on.
      	</li>
      	<%= image_tag 'Discord_instructions_1.png', :class => "discord_images" %>
      	<li>
      		Then locate your name in the server and right click to find "Copy ID".
      	</li>
			<%= image_tag 'Discord_instructions_2.png', :class => "discord_images" %>
      	<li>Your ID is now in your clipboard, paste it into the Edit Account page on this site.</li>

        (supposedly there is another way to do this, but im not a wizard.)
